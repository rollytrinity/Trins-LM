<h1>Trin's Fantastic Language Model Explorer</h1>

The web application was created for the University of Edinburgh's Computing in the Classroom course, where we aim to learn and implement pedagogies for computing education. It is designed as a simple and interactive explanation of language models.

The project can be run locally by creating a conda environment with `environment.yml`. Run command `streamlit run app.py`.

Note that the project will run slowly - interactive demos require loading of models that are too big to be stored locally.
